# To do

## Features

- Library: add some magic to OAuth init + restore
- Client: maybe use HTTParty
- Track#download: yield bytes received (for progress) if block_given?
- Track#data: yield io (from file or response) if block_given?

## Fixes

- bin/skyjam: robust CLI
- Client: clean up the mess and redundancy
- document this stuff
- cleaner exceptions
- specs, with Google Music API mocking
